## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ElasticsearchTraining.git
cd ElasticsearchTraining
```

### 2. Start Elasticsearch and Kibana

```bash
# Navigate to docker directory
cd docker

# Start the stack
docker-compose up -d

# Verify services are running
docker-compose ps
```

Wait for services to be ready (usually 2-3 minutes). You can check:

- Kibana: <http://localhost:5601>

### 3. Run the Training Application

```bash
# Navigate to the application directory
cd src/ElasticTraining

# Restore dependencies
dotnet restore

# Run the application
dotnet run
```

The application will be available at: <https://localhost:5001>

## ÔøΩ Training Materials

1. **Introduction to Elasticsearch** - Architecture, concepts, and basic operations
2. **Data Modeling and Mapping** - Document structure, field types, and index design
3. **Search and Query DSL** - Powerful search capabilities and query construction
4. **Aggregations and Analytics** - Data analysis and statistical operations
5. **Log Management** - Practical log analysis scenarios
6. **Production Considerations** - Performance, monitoring, and best practices

### Documentation

- **[Student Textbook](docs/Textbook/)** - Complete learning materials in modular format
- **[HTTP Examples](docs/HttpRequests/)** - Ready-to-use request collections for practice

## üí° How to Use for Training

### For Instructors

1. Review the [lesson plan](docs/Lesson-Plan.md) for structured 6-hour curriculum
2. Start Elasticsearch and Kibana using Docker Compose
3. Run the log simulator application
4. Use provided HTTP request examples for demonstrations
5. Guide students through hands-on exercises

### For Self-Learning

1. Start with the [textbook materials](docs/Textbook/Textbook.md)
2. Set up the environment using Docker Compose
3. Work through practical exercises using the log simulator
4. Practice with provided HTTP request collections
5. Explore real-time data analysis with generated logs

## üîç Training Scenarios

### Real-time Log Analysis

The application generates realistic log data including:

- **Service Logs** - Application performance and error tracking
- **HTTP Request Logs** - API usage patterns and response times  
- **Exception Handling** - Error analysis with stack traces
- **Business Metrics** - Service-level indicators and trends

### Sample Queries

Test your skills with these scenarios in Kibana Dev Tools:

```bash
# Monitor error rates by service
GET /application_logs-*/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "error_by_service": {
      "terms": {"field": "service_name"},
      "aggs": {
        "error_rate": {
          "filter": {"term": {"level": "ERROR"}}
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

# Find slow API responses
GET /application_logs-*/_search
{
  "query": {
    "range": {
      "response_time_ms": {"gte": 1000}
    }
  },
  "sort": [{"response_time_ms": {"order": "desc"}}]
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Application Settings

Configure Elasticsearch connection in `src/ElasticTraining/appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "Elasticsearch": {
    "Uri": "http://localhost:9200",
    "Username": "",
    "Password": ""
  }
}
```

### Docker Configuration

The included Docker Compose setup provides:

- **Elasticsearch 8.13.4** - Single node cluster optimized for development
- **Kibana 8.13.4** - Data visualization and dev tools interface
- **Persistent Storage** - Data persists between container restarts
